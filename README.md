## [CVPR 2026 Findings] Revisiting Image Manipulation Localization under Realistic Manipulation Scenarios

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of our CVPR 2026 Findings paper: "[Revisiting Image Manipulation Localization under Realistic Manipulation Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20006)".
![RITA Motivation](figs/intro.png)  

RITA is a model framework that first identifies the phenomenon of dimension collapse in image manipulation localization, where realistic manipulation scenarios are often reduced to simplified binary localization settings. Beyond proposing a new framework, RITA provides a systematic discussion of this issue from three perspectives: dataset construction, model design, and future research directions. In particular, it highlights the importance of moving beyond static tampered-region annotations toward process-aware manipulation understanding, aiming to promote more realistic and generalizable image manipulation localization.

### Code & Dataset Release

We are gradually releasing the code, pretrained models, and datasets for this project.

### Currently Available

* Inference code under the CAT-Net protocol
* Training code



## Test

<details>
<summary>Inference under the CAT-Net protocol</summary>
Please first download the required files from Baidu Netdisk:

```

Before running the inference script, please modify the dataset paths in `test.py` and `test_robustness.py` according to your local environment. Then replace the checkpoint path in `test.sh` with the downloaded pretrained model path.

After that, run:

```bash
bash test.sh
```

</details>

## Train

<details>
<summary>Training under the CAT-Net protocol</summary>

Before running the training script, please modify the dataset paths in the corresponding JSON configuration files according to your local environment.

After that, run:

```bash
sh train_catnet.sh
```

</details>

### TODO List

We will continue to update this repository with the following components:

* ✅ Inference code
* ✅ Training code
* [ ] Synthetic datasets
* [ ] HSIM dataset
* [ ] Autoregressive inference code

More code and data will be made publicly available as soon as possible.
